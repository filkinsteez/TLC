			<h3>Dry Mouth</h3>
			<p>
				Everyone’s mouth feels dry from time to time in moments such as excessive thirst or anxiety but this should not be confused with dry mouth (Xerostomia), a condition in which the salivary glands fail regularly to produce sufficient saliva.  It has multiple causes including more than 400 medicines that adversely affect the salivary glands; several diseases including diabetes, high blood pressure, Parkinsons; HIV/AIDS, and Sjorgren’s Syndrome; radiation therapy; chemotherapy; and head and neck nerve damage.<br>
			</p>
			<p>
				Dry mouth is a serious health risk because saliva keeps the mouth wet; prevents decay, abscesses, and infections by controlling oral bacteria and fungi; enables tasting, chewing, and swallowing; and facilitates speaking and digestion.<br><br>
