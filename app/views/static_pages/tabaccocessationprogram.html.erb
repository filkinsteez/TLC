				<b>The Hold of Tobacco</b><br>
				Mark Twain once said: “Quitting smoking is easy.  I’ve done it a thousand times.”
				Quitting the use of tobacco is, of course, not easy because all forms of it: cigarettes, cigars, pipes, and smokeless, contain nicotine that is capable of causing addiction and dependence.<br>
			</p>
