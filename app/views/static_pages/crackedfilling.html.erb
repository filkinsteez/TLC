			<h3>Cracked or Lost Filling</h3>
			<p>
				A cracked or lost filling renders your tooth vulnerable to decay and infection that may result in a root canal treatment or extraction if it is not immediately addressed.  To preserve your tooth, you should seek prompt treatment from TLC Dental.  We will carefully examine your tooth and protect it with a new filling.  <br>
			</p>
			<p>
				During this restorative procedure you will enjoy the comfort of our signature “Gentle Dentistry.” <br>
