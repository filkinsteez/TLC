				The American Dental Association Council on Scientific Affairs reports that a properly fitted athletic mouthguard is the best protective device for reducing the incidence and severity of sports-related dental injuries to the teeth and soft tissues (mouth, lip, tongue, inner lining of cheeks).  It achieves this by providing a resilient, protective surface to distribute and dissipate forces on impact, thereby minimizing the severity of traumatic injury.<br>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Why Wear an Athletic Mouthguard</b><br>
				The consequences of not wearing an athletic mouthguard in sports or any activity with dental injury risk are daunting:
			</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Every athlete in a contact sport has a 10% chance each season of sustaining an orofacial injury.</li>
					<li>Every athlete in a contact sport has a 33% to 56% chance of sustaining an orofacial injury during his/her athletic career</li>
					<li>An athlete is 60 times more likely to sustain teeth damage when not wearing an athletic mouthguard.</li>
				</ul>
			<p>
				<b>Who Should Wear an Athletic Mouthguard</b><br>
				The American Dental Association recommends custom fitted athletic mouthguards for any sport or activity with dental injury risk.<br>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>TLC Athletic Mouthguard vs. a Store Mouthguard</b><br>
				Sporting Goods stores, drugstores, and webstores offer an array of “stock” and “boil and bite” athletic mouthguards.  They far surpass us in marketing.We far surpass them in oral protection.<br>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>An athletic mouthguard that is not custom fitted provides only a low level of protection</li>
				<li>An athletic mouthguard that is not custom fitted will interfere with speech and breathing</li>
				<li>An athletic mouthguard that is not custom fitted will lack retention</li>
				<li>An athletic mouthguard that is not custom fitted may, in the event of a serious concussion, dislodge and obstruct an airway</li>
				<li>Custom fitted athletic mouthguards are the only ones recommended by the American Dental Association and the Academy for Sports Dentistry.</li>
				<li>TLC athletic mouthguards are custom fitted. Those offered by Sporting Goods stores, drugstores, and webstores are not.</li> 
			</ul>
			<p>
				In sum, if you or a member of your family engage in any sport or activity with dental injury risk and desire optimum mouthguard protection you should promptly contact TLC Dental for a custom fitted athletic mouthguard.<br>
