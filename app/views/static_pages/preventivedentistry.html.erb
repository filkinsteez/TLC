			<h3>Oral Cancer Screening</h3>
			<p>
				Oral cancer is an abnormal growth of cells in the lips, tongue, mouth, and throat that may spread to other areas of the body.  It is a devastating and deadly cancer that often goes unnoticed until it has progressed to later stages.				
			</p>
			<b>Statistics and Consequences of Oral Cancer are Humbling</b>
			<ul>
				<li>Approximately 100 people in the U.S. are diagnosed with oral cancer every day</li>
				<li>One person in the U.S. dies from oral cancer every hour</li>
				<li>Of these oral cancer fatalities, 70% were not screened regularly and when diagnosed were at a late malignancy stage</li>
				<li>25% of all oral cancer victims have no risk factors</li>
				<li>Devastating facial effects generally attend late stage oral cancer</li>
			</ul>
			<b>Treatment Options for Oral Cancer are Progressively Challenging</b>
			<ul>
				<li>Early stage treatment is usually limited to simple removal of the diseased tissue</li>
				<li>If the diseased tissue is not treated early and is invasive, treatment may involve removing a large portion of the tongue, lower jaw, or throat</li>
				<li>Treatment for later stage cancer that spreads to other areas of the body may involve chemotherapy, radiation, and surgical removal of tissue and organs</li>
			</ul>	
			<%= image_tag 'acs_logo.jpg', :class => "float-right" %>	
			<b>Risk Factors for Oral Cancer</b>
			<ul>
				<li>Previous history of oral cancer or precancerous lesions</li>
				<li>Tobacco use at all ages (cigarettes, cigars, pipes, smokeless tobacco)</li>
				<li>Alcohol consumption</li>
				<li>Marijuana use</li>
				<li>Age 40 or older</li>
				<li>Gender: men are twice as likely to develop oral cancer than women</li>
				<li>Human papillomavirus (HPV) 16/18 infection (a common and often unrecognized sexually transmitted virus)</li>	
			</ul>
			<p>
				<b>Importance of Early Oral Cancer Detection</b><br>
				As oral cancer is 90% curable when detected early and as later detection can hold grave consequences, you should immediately schedule a TLC oral cancer screening if you are subject to any of the above risk factors.  And as 25% of all oral cancer victims have no risk factors, you should schedule regular TLC “Recares” that include oral cancer screenings.
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>TLC Oral Cancer Screening</b><br>
				Although important, a visual oral cancer exam using just the eye fails to identify a majority of early lesions.  It should be supplemented by chemiluminescent technology that has proven clinically successful in identifying suspicious abnormalities in the earliest stages of development.
			</p>
			<p>
				That’s why at TLC Dental, we provide you with optimal oral cancer screening by using a combination of a careful visual examination and the ADA approved ViziLite Plus T Blue detection system. The latter begins with a desiccating (drying) pre-rinse that makes cell nuclei more visible to our special light.  A temporary and non-toxic blue dye is applied to suspicious areas.  The dye is retained only on lesions with active cells that are marked for further evaluation, monitoring, and diagnosis.
			</p>

				<b>Gentle Comfort</b><br>
				During the brief oral cancer screening you will enjoy the comfort of our signature “Gentle Dentistry.”

			<h3>Professional Dental Cleaning</h3>
			<%= image_tag 'recaretooth.jpg', :class => "float-right" %>
			<p>
				A Professional Dental Cleaning or “Recare” figures prominently in Dream Smile Solutions, Common Dental Problems, and Preventive Dentistry.  It is in many ways the copestone of our collective dental treatments and is fundamental to achieving and maintaining your “Dream Smile”.  For details on Recare click here.

			<h3>Sealants</h3>
			<p>
				Sealants are thin resinous films or coatings that are brushed on the chewing surfaces of back teeth to protect them from decay.  
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Importance</b><br>
				Tooth decay, particularly in children is fraught with problems. When it occurs it must be removed and a filling restoration emplaced that unfortunately holds future complications.  Studies show that filling restored teeth of children will generally fracture by the age of 35 and then require root canal treatments, crowns, or extractions.
			</p>
			<p>
				Sealant protection is essential because the pits and fissures of molars and premolars are often narrower than a toothbrush bristle and are difficult to clean.  Indeed, without sealants, the average person has a 95% chance of experiencing a cavity in these teeth and little chance of experiencing a cavity with intact sealants.
			</p>
			<p>
				As the chewing surface of children’s teeth is most susceptible to decay, sealants should be applied to newly erupted permanent teeth and in some cases to primary teeth.   Although critical for children, the preventative benefits of sealants extend to people of all ages.  
			</p>
			<p>
				If your molar and pre-molar teeth are presently free of decay and fillings, you should insure their continued health and appearance by promptly contacting TLC Dental for sealant protection.
			</p>
			<%= image_tag 'sealants.jpg', :class => "float-right" %>	
			<p>
				<b>Treatment</b><br>
				Sealing teeth is a short and simple procedure.  First, we thoroughly clean your tooth and apply a preparatory solution that facilitates sealant adhesion.  When the tooth is clean and dry, we meticulously brush a thin film of sealant on the tooth’s surface and then harden it with a curing light.  The entire process is completed in a matter of minutes.
			</p>
			<p>

				<b>Gentle Comfort</b><br>
				In the preparation and application of your sealant, you will enjoy the comfort of our signature “Gentle Dentistry.”
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Sealant Durability</b><br>
				Sealants are very durable and normally last for many years. Their condition is carefully monitored by TLC hygienists during biannual Professional Dental Cleanings and if infractions are detected, they reapply the sealant and resecure the tooth.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>More Information</b><br>
				For more information on sealants, click on Dr. Rothenberg’s Dental Encyclopedia and Dr. Rothenberg’s Dental Dictionary.  And for prompt sealant protection of your teeth, please call the TLC Dental Group Fayetteville / Manlius office at 315-637-7684.

			<h3>TLC Athletic Mouthguards</h3>
			<div class="row-fluid">

			<p>
				The American Dental Association Council on Scientific Affairs reports that a properly fitted athletic mouthguard is the best protective device for reducing the incidence and severity of sports-related dental injuries to the teeth and soft tissues (mouth, lip, tongue, inner lining of cheeks).  It achieves this by providing a resilient, protective surface to distribute and dissipate forces on impact, thereby minimizing the severity of traumatic injury.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Why Wear an Athletic Mouthguard</b><br>
				The consequences of not wearing an athletic mouthguard in sports or any activity with dental injury risk are daunting:
				<ul>
					<li>Every athlete in a contact sport has a 10% chance each season of sustaining an orofacial injury.</li>
					<li>Every athlete in a contact sport has a 33% to 56% chance of sustaining an orofacial injury during his/her athletic career</li>
					<li>An athlete is 60 times more likely to sustain teeth damage when not wearing an athletic mouthguard.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Who Should Wear an Athletic Mouthguard</b><br>
				The American Dental Association recommends custom fitted athletic mouthguards for any sport or activity with dental injury risk.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>TLC Athletic Mouthguard vs. a Store Mouthguard</b><br>
				Sporting Goods stores, drugstores, and webstores offer an array of “stock” and “boil and bite” athletic mouthguards.  They far surpass us in marketing.We far surpass them in oral protection.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>An athletic mouthguard that is not custom fitted provides only a low level of protection</li>
				<li>An athletic mouthguard that is not custom fitted will interfere with speech and breathing</li>
				<li>An athletic mouthguard that is not custom fitted will lack retention</li>
				<li>An athletic mouthguard that is not custom fitted may, in the event of a serious concussion, dislodge and obstruct an airway</li>
				<li>Custom fitted athletic mouthguards are the only ones recommended by the American Dental Association and the Academy for Sports Dentistry.</li>
				<li>TLC athletic mouthguards are custom fitted. Those offered by Sporting Goods stores, drugstores, and webstores are not.</li> 
			</ul>
			<p>
				In sum, if you or a member of your family engage in any sport or activity with dental injury risk and desire optimum mouthguard protection you should promptly contact TLC Dental for a custom fitted athletic mouthguard.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Custom Fitting a TLC Athletic Mouthguard</b><br>
				To prepare your custom fitted athletic mouthguard we will carefully examine your teeth, gums, and soft tissues and will make a precise mold for your mouthguard that is then made to our exacting specifications by either Glidewell or Bite Tech dental laboratories.   Unlike one size fits all “stock” and “boil and bite” mouthguards, your TLC athletic mouthguard will fulfill all of the criteria of the Academy for Sports Dentistry in being custom fitted, comfortable, odorless, tasteless, optimally designed for speaking and breathing, properly layered for protection and durability, resilient, and retentive. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Durability</b><br>
				Glidewell and Bite Tech employ the most advanced Multi-Layered Pressure Laminated technology to create your custom made TLC athletic to assure necessary thickness, protection and durability.

			<h3>TLC Dream Smile Diet</h3>
			<p>
				Attaining and maintaining your “Dream Smile” is dependent on a dental friendly diet best represented by the Healthy Eating Plate of Harvard’s School of Public Health and supplemented by TLC’s Dream Smile Diet tips.
			</p>
			<p>
				Healthy Eating Plate and Dental Health
				Your general health requires a well balanced and nutritional diet for which the Healthy Eating Plate provides the guidelines.
			</p>
			<div class="row-fluid" style="text-align:center;">
				<div class="span12">
					<%= image_tag 'healthyeating.jpg' %>
				</div>
			</div> 
			<p>
				A well balanced and nutritional diet is particularly important to your dental health.  Indeed, the mouth might be considered a nutritional barometer as evidenced by these examples:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Your teeth and jaws are largely made of calcium found in foods such as dairy products and beans</li>
				<li>Tongue inflammation can be caused by lack of iron in foods such as bran cereals and nuts</li>
				<li>Bad breath and canker sores can be caused by lack of niacin in foods such as chicken and fish</li>
				<li>Mouth sores can be caused by lack of Vitamins B12 and B2 in foods such as chicken, fish, and spinach</li>
				<li>Bleeding gums and loose teeth can be caused by lack of Vitamin C in foods such as oranges and strawberries</li>
				<li>Dry mouth can be caused by lack of Vitamin D found in enriched milk and fish</li>
				<li>Periodontal disease can progress more quickly and severely from nutrient deficiency</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				<b>TLC Dream Smile Diet Booklet</b><br>
				Although Harvard’s guidelines are essential to your dental health, some approved food and drink could impair your “Dream Smile”.  Accordingly, TLC Dental Group has prepared a supplementary booklet of diet tips to further protect your smile.  The following are excerpts from the booklet:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Fermentable carbohydrates such as bread, crackers, bananas, and breakfast cereals thatbreak down in the mouth and form damaging acids are of particular concern to your “Dream Smile”. These foods should be carefully selected, eaten in moderation, and at times paired beneficially with other foods  For example, crackers might be eaten with aged, hard cheese to counter acidity  Cereals with low sugar content should be preferred to those high in sugar.</li>

				<li>Food and drink with high acidity also can compromise your “Dream Smile” by contributing todental erosion.  You should rinse your mouth with water after consuming acidic foods such as fruit juices, pickles, and lemons</li>

				<li>Snacking between meals should be avoided or minimized and should exclude highly sweetened food and  “sticky carbohydrates” such as potato chips that linger longer on the teeth, lodgebetween them, and enable prolonged acidic formation and erosion.</li> 

				<li>Water should be your beverage of choice. The drinking of sodas should be avoided or minimized, limited to small rather than large containers, and consumed through straws.</li>

				<li>Vegan and vegetarian diets in which fruit constitutes more than two-thirds of the whole should be reviewed by TLC Dental to assure that they are fully nutritional and not unduly acidic.</li>

				<li>Children’s mouths are of particular dietary concern. Baby bottle tooth decay is caused when a baby’s teeth are in extended contact with milk, sugared food and drink.   Sugared commercial snacks for children promote cavities and set a pattern for adult snacking.  And “sticky carbohydrates” should be avoided by children with braces.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>

			<h3>TLC Flouride Treatment </h3>
			<p>			
				Fluoride is a mineral that is found naturally in air, water, soil, and foods such meat, fish, eggs, and tea. (( It also is found in city water systems, toothpastes, mouthwashes, pills and gels )) and it is essential to the formation and maintenance of healthy teeth.
			</p>
			<p>
				Enamel, the outer layer of a tooth, is composed of dense mineral crystals that are continuously dissolved by acids formed by plaque bacteria in a process called demineralization.  In turn, minerals such as calcium and phosphate are continuously redeposited in the enamel and are facilitated and hardened by fluoride. Without this process of remineralization your teeth would decay.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Forms of Fluoride</b><br>
				Fluoride is either topical or systemic in form.  Topical fluorides, including toothpastes, mouthwashes, and professional fluoride treatments, are applied directly to tooth enamel.  Systemic fluorides in food, water, and dietary supplements are ingested and provide dental benefits systemically. A combination of topical and systemic fluorides is deemed most beneficial by the American Dental Association.
			</p>
			<%= image_tag 'flouridetooth.jpg', :class => "float-right" %>
			<p>
			<b>Benefits of Fluoride</b>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Remineralization</li>
				<li>Hardens the enamel of baby teeth </li>
				<li>Hardens the enamel of unerupted and erupted permanent teeth</li>
				<li>Reverses early decay</li>
				<li>Disrupts acid formation in the teeth of children and adults</li>
				<li>Deters the formation of cavities</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<b>Risks of Fluoride</b><br>
				Normally fluoride is exceptionally beneficial but there can be too much of a good thing for in high doses it may be hazardous, particularly to children for who might develop fluorosis and teeth discoloration. This easily treatable condition largely results from children drinking well water with high fluoride levels or swallowing excessive amounts of toothpaste and/or supplementary pills It does not derive from municipal fluoridated water that has safe and strictly controlled levels of fluoridation.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Fluoride Supplements and Treatments</b><br>
				The dental health of some children and adults may require additional fluoride.  Children who have cavities, who are at high risk for cavities, or who do not drink fluoridated water might require fluoride supplements to avoid the risks of fluoride deficiency. 
			</p>
			<p>
			You might need additional fluoride if:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You are taking certain medications</li>
				<li>You suffer from dry mouth (xerostomia)</li>
				<li>You suffer from gingivitis</li>
				<li>You have loose gum pockets</li>
				<li>You wear braces</li>
				<li>You have crowns and/or bridges</li>
				<li>You almost exclusively drink bottled or well water lacking fluoride</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				If you or any member of your family is subject to these risk factors, you should promptly contact TLC Dental for a consultation to determine whether fluoride supplements and/or treatments would be needed to provide for your dental health.

			<h3>TLC Oral Hygiene</h3>

			<p>
				A program of good oral hygiene is to your “Dream Smile” as a good maintenance program is to your car.  It keeps everything working and looking great.  To further this analogy we might view dental plaque as the equivalent of automotive rust.  Absent proper cleaning, both will develop and then discolor, deteriorate, and destroy structural integrity.  In short, without a program of good care, a new car becomes a clunker; a Dream Smile becomes decay.  Only a combined personal and professional oral hygiene program can achieve and maintain your “Dream Smile”.
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>Personal Oral Hygiene</b><br>
				TLC Dental has prepared a Personal Oral Hygiene booklet to assist you in practicing good oral hygiene. The following are excerpts from the booklet:
			</p>
			<%= image_tag 'dentalfloss.jpg', :class => "float-left" %>
			<p>
			<b>Flossing</b>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Flossing prior to brushing is equally if not more important than brushing itself.</li>
				<li>In flossing, you should gently insert the floss between the teeth and bring it up and down several times while forming a C shape around the teeth and extending it below the gum line.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<b>The Advantages of TLC Rotadent Brushing</b><br>
				The Rotadent has proven far more effective than any manual or electric toothbrush in maintaining dental health.  Click here to learn the many advantages of a Rotadent.
			</p>
			<%= image_tag 'rotadent.jpg', :class => "float-right" %>
			<p>
			<b>Manual Brushing</b>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>If you use a manual toothbrush, it should have a small (1” to ½”) head with 		   soft, rounded bristles.</li>
				<li>You should use a fluoride and tartar control toothpaste bearing the ADA seal of approval and, if recommended by TLC, a desensitizing toothpaste for	sensitive teeth. A pea s
				<li>In brushing, you should hold your brush at a 45 degree angle and, beginning with the front or cheek side of your top teeth, gently brush up and down away from your gum line in small sections.  Rinse your brush after each section and proceed to your lower teeth and then to the tongue side of you teeth.</li>
				<li>After brushing your teeth, you should brush your tongue.</li>
				<li>You should replace your toothbrush every three to four months or sooner if the bristles lose structure and always replace it after a cold.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
			<b>Rinsing</b>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>There are two types of rinses or mouthwashes that are used before or after brushing to address food particles, bacteria, fluoridation, and bad breath.</li>
				<li>Prescription rinses are for patients with specific oral diseases.  Over-the-counter rinses are for general use but vary in nature and are best selected in consultation with TLC Dental.</li>  
				<li>In rinsing, you should use the recommended amount of rinse, completely clear the rinse from your mouth, and after rinsing refrain from eating, drinking, or smoking for thirty minutes.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
			<b>How Often and How Long Should You Floss, Brush, and Rinse,</b>
			</p>
				<ul>
				<li>You should floss for 2 to 3 minutes after every meal and snack or at least twice a day.</li>
				<li>You should brush your teeth for 3 to 4 minutes after every meal and snack or at least twice a day.</li>
				<li>If you are unable to floss and brush after a meal or snack, you should thoroughly rinse your mouth with water.</li>
				<li>Water rinsing in the absence of flossing and brushing might be supplemented with sugarless gum containing Xylitol that reduces bacteria in the mouth and buffers it against acid.</li>
				<li>You should rinse your mouth for 30 seconds after every flossing and brushing</li>
				<li>After eating acidic foods such as citrus fruits and tomatoes, you should rinse your mouth with water and wait at least 30 minutes before brushing to avoid brushing acid into your teeth.
			</ul>
			<p>
				<b>Oral Hygiene for Children</b>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Even before the arrival of primary teeth, parents should wipe an infant’s mouth with a washcloth or gauze pad to prevent build-up of plaque and bacteria</li>
				<li>Small children should be given a safe “toddler brush” with an oblong shape that prevents it from being swallowed</li>
				<li>Children under the age of 6 should be given only a baby-pea sized amount of toothpaste and should not be given fluoride rinses.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<b>Professional Oral Hygiene</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>TLC Recare</b><br>
				Even the most exacting personal oral hygiene is not sufficient to protect your dental health and maintain your “Dream Smile”.  Only a trained hygienist with advanced professional equipment in a biannual or, if needed, more frequent Professional Dental Cleaning or “Recare” can perform the diagnostic, preventive, and aesthetic procedures that are essential for your dental health and “Dream Smile”. Indeed, without regular Recares you risk stains, gum disease, bone loss, and even oral cancer that cannot be detected and addressed by personal oral hygiene.  Click here for details on this vital dental procedure.  
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>TLC Soft Tissue Management</b><br>
				Much like the Recare, essential elements of our Soft Tissue Management system, including periodontal examinations, removal of tartar and calculus through scaling and root planing with the Cavitron Jet Plus, and Arestin and fluoride treatments cannot be achieved through personal oral hygiene.  The health of your teeth and gum tissues depends on both good personal oral hygiene and STM.   Click here for details on this important dental system.

			<p>
				<b>TLC Rotadent vs. Manual Toothbrush</b><br>
				Quite simply, the TLC Rotadent has rendered the manual toothbrush obsolete in maintaining your dental health and Dream Smile.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The TLC Rotadent was clinically proven to remove 92% of plaque in its first minute of use, twice as fast as a manual toothbrush.</li>
				<li>In a ten year study, almost 70% of Rotadent users exhibited good to very good oral hygiene levels compared to 25% for manual toothbrush users.</li>
			</ul>
			<%= image_tag 'rotadentbristle.jpg', :class => "float-left" %>
			<p>
				The proprietary MicroAccess filaments on the Rotadent®  fit into tight interproximal spaces that conventional brushes can’t reach. These filaments, along with the 360-degree sweeping action — a feature only found on the Rotadent®  — clean out plaque and bacteria from these difficult-to-reach areas.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>TLC Rotadent vs. Drugstore Electric Toothbrushes</b><br>
				The comparison between a TLC Rotadent and a drugstore electric toothbrush is akin to that of a TLC tooth whitening and a drugstore tooth whitening.  There is simply no comparison.   The TLC Rotadent dramatically outperforms any drugstore electric toothbrush as evidenced by this video.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Lifetime Warranty</b><br>
				Further attesting to the disparity in quality and performance between a TLC Rotadent and a drugstore electric toothbrush is the limited Lifetime Warranty that you enjoy with a TLC Rotadent.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Maintain Your Dental Health and Dream Smile</b><br>
				Because of its exceptional cleaning capacity for teeth and gums the TLC Rotadent is the centerpiece of TLC Dental’s Soft Tissue Management Program that enables you to attain and maintain your dental health.  And in this way it contributes invaluably to your “Dream Smile”.

				<b>The Hold of Tobacco</b><br>
				Mark Twain once said: “Quitting smoking is easy.  I’ve done it a thousand times.”
				Quitting the use of tobacco is, of course, not easy because all forms of it: cigarettes, cigars, pipes, and smokeless, contain nicotine that is capable of causing addiction and dependence. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>TLC Tobacco Cessation Assistance</b><br>
				TLC Dental is well positioned to assist you in quitting the use of tobacco because its ill effects often appear first in the mouth.  We can offer you a wealth of resources provided by the American Dental Association to counter tobacco use   and we can develop a program to fit your personal needs, including prescriptive medications and referrals to local support groups and specialists in anti-tobacco treatment.
