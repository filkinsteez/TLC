			<h6><b>Whitening</b></h6>
			<ul>
				<li>Removes stains from drinking coffee, tea, colas, and red wine</li>
				<li>Removes stains from eating pigmented food such as cherries and blueberries</li>
				<li>Removes stains from smoking and chewing tobacco</li>
				<li>Removes stains from various medications </li>
				<li>Removes discoloration from tartar deposits and bacterial pigmentation</li>
				<li>Brightens dull colored teeth</li>
				<li>Creates your “Dream Smile”</li>
			</ul>
			<h6><b>Whitening Procedure</b></h6>
			<p>
				TLC professional tooth whitening is either directly supervised with the Polus Whitening Accelerator or indirectly supervised with custom-fitted whitening trays. In both approaches the first step is a thorough examination of your teeth and gums to determine their suitability for whitening and an appropriate method for treating surface (extrinsic) and interior (intrinsic) stains.

			<h6><b>Whitening with the Polus Whitening Accelerator </b></h6>
			<p>
				If the examination is favorable for whitening, we roll out the Polus Whitening Accelerator by Beyond Dental, the ultimate in tooth whitening technology.  Its distinctive LightBridge system combines halogen and LED light sources for superior whitening power while advanced filtration ensures your safety by removing all harmful heat and ultraviolet output.  Three flexible settings tailor the treatment to your tooth sensitivity level and a detachable LED curing light enables spot whitening of a single tooth.<br>
			</p>
			<p>
				A Polus Whitening Treatment consists of three safe and successive 10 minute sessions.  It begins with a hygienic cleaning and polishing of your teeth. This is followed by setting the Polus for your tooth sensitivity level, securing your gum and lip tissue with a protective gel, and then applying a specially formulated whitening gel to your teeth that is activated by the Polus LightBridge system. After each of the first two sessions we remove and then reapply the whitening gel.  We monitor your three 10 minute sessions while you relax and watch a selection of your choice on a Pansonic HDTV and while your stains and discoloration dissolve into a “Dream Smile”.

				<b>Custom-Fitted Tray Activated Whitening</b>
				If the examination is favorable for whitening and you prefer indirectly supervised whitening, we begin with a hygienic cleaning and polishing of your teeth.  This is followed by taking a detailed impression of your teeth to create individualized, custom-fitted trays for your upper and lower teeth.  We then give you the personalized trays, properly formulated whitening gel, and detailed treatment instructions for two hour daily or nightly applications during a period of about two weeks.  At the end of this period, you will have a bright and shining smile.
			</p>
			<h6><b>TLC Whitening vs. Drugstore Whitening</b></h6>
			<p>
				Drugstore and supermarket shelves hold an array of tooth whitening products in the form of toothpastes, strips, pens, rinses, and kits.  They far surpass us in marketing.  We far surpass them in bright and healthy smiles.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>90% of TLC tooth whitening procedures are successful.  Drugstore whitening success is questionable.</li><br>
				<li>TLC carefully determines the optimum gel calibration, ranging from 20% to 45%, for each patient.  Drugstore gel is a one-size-fits-all 3%.</li><br>
				<li>TLC tooth whitening can lighten teeth by 3 to 8 shades; drugstore whitening by 1 shade.</li><br>
				<li>The results of one 30 minute TLC Polus whitening treatment far surpass those of drugstore whitening products lasting weeks or months.</li><br>
				<li>TLC whitening will not jeopardize your health.  Our thorough dental exam disqualifies from treatment those patients whose health would be at risk including patients with cavities, cracked fillings, unduly thin enamel, active gum disease, exposed roots, allergy to peroxide, and patients who are under suitable age, pregnant or lactating.  Drugstore whitening products do not examine you for these risks and can be harmful to your health.</li><br>
				<li>We custom fit your whitening trays or mouthpiece to maximize gel exposure to your teeth and minimize any exposure to your gums and soft tissue.  Drugstores offer ill-fitting, “one-size fits all” trays that allow bleaching gel to seep into and inflame gums and soft tissue.</li>
			</ul>	
			<p>
				In sum, TLC Whitening gives you a far more dazzling and healthy smile than drugstore whitening.  And your stunning TLC smile is achieved in far less time than your token drugstore smile.
			</p>				
			<p>
				<b>Gentle Comfort</b><br>
				Throughout our whitening procedure, you will enjoy the comfort of our signature “Gentle Dentistry.”
			</p>				
			<p>
				<b>Whitening Durability</b><br>
				The durability of whitening largely depends on good dental hygiene and regular dental checkups.  Proper care will greatly extend the luster of whitening.
			</p>
			<p>
			<p>
				<b>Whitening Appearance</b><br>
				TLC whitening perfectly reflects our motto “The Art of Gentle Dentistry.”  Our professional procedure provides for your comfort and dental health. .  And in artfully whitening your teeth, we add dazzle to your “Dream Smile.”
