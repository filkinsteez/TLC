			<h3>Sleep Apnea</h3>
			<p>
				Sleep apnea is a serious sleeping disorder affecting some 18 million Americans whose sleep is disrupted by brief periods in which they stop breathing.  Each of these periods lasts ten or more seconds and occurs ten to sixty times during a night’s sleep. There are two types of sleep apnea.  In obstructive sleep apnea, the most common type, the throat airway closes briefly while breathing efforts continue.  In central sleep apnea the airway is not blocked but the brain temporarily fails to signal the muscles to breathe normally.<br>
			</p>	
			<p>
				Although not proven causal, the following are risk factors for sleep apnea: physical abnormality in the nose and throat, high blood pressure, obesity, and the use of tobacco, alcohol, sedatives, and certain medicines.<br>
			</p>
			<p>
				If sleep apnea is left untreated its consequences may be grave and life threatening, including daytime lethargy and sleepiness, depression, high blood pressure, diabetes, heart attack, and stroke.
