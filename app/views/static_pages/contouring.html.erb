			<h3>Dental Contouring</h3> 
			<p>
				Dental contouring is twofold.  Tooth Contouring is a quick and comfortable procedure to improve the shape, length, and surface of teeth.  Gum contouring is a complementary procedure to reshape your gums for healthy dental support and a radiant smile.

				<b>Contouring Procedure</b>
				Our first step in TLC tooth contouring is a careful digital X-ray exam to determine the size and location of the tooth’s pulp (the center of the tooth that contains the nerves and blood vessels) and whether contouring or another procedure such as bonding or veneers would be most appropriate.<br>
			</p>
			<p>
				If the exam is favorable for tooth contouring, a handpiece or laser is used to gently sculpt the tooth by removing traces of surface enamel.  Once properly shaped and adjusted, the tooth is smoothed, and polished.  In less than thirty minutes, an imperfect tooth is transformed into a radiant tooth worthy of a (Dream Smile).<br>
			</p>
			<p>
				The first step in aesthetic gum contouring is a thorough exam of your gum tissue for treatment.  If our exam is favorable and your gum line is irregular, we will mark a desired line and gently sculpt the gum to conform to the line thereby providing your teeth with an enhancing rather than distracting gum line.<br>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Gentle Comfort</b><br>
				Throughout the contouring procedure, you will enjoy the comfort of our signature “Gentle Dentistry.”
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Contouring Durability</b><br>
				The durability of contouring largely depends on good dental hygiene and regular dental checkups to remove sub-gingival bacteria that cause gum disease.  Proper care will extend the aesthetic benefits of contouring.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Contouring Appearance</b><br>
				TLC contouring perfectly reflects our motto “The Art of Gentle Dentistry.”  We provide for your comfort in the procedure and for improved dental health in carefully contoured teeth.  And in artfully shaping your teeth and gums, we provide a truly resplendent addition to your “Dream Smile.”
