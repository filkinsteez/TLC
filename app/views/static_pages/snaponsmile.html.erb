			<h3>TLC Snap-On Smile</h3> <h4>A perfect smile <br> & <br> A dream come true</h4><br> 
			<b>Those Special Moments</b>
			<p>
				Are there moments when you dream of a perfect smile but don’t have the time or funds for a complete dental makeover?<br>
			</p>
			<p>
				Moments such as celebrations, graduations, weddings, proms, parties, dates, dinners, reunions, and interviews when a perfect smile would make a moment perfect.<br> 
			</p>
			<p>
				If so, TLC’s Snap-On Smile is your dream come true. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>What is a TLC Snap-On Smile</b><br>
				A TLC Snap-On Smile is a set of perfect teeth made of ultra-modern dental resin that quickly, easily, comfortably, and securely fits over your own teeth without any adhesives to immediately give you a radiant smile.<br>
			</p>
			<p>
				The TLC Snap-On Smile was designed by a renowned dentist after years of research and development to give you perfect teeth with which to eat, drink, talk, laugh, and smile normally.  Although very thin and lightweight, it is also remarkably strong.  It fits snuggly over your teeth like a glove and is easy to snap on and off.

				<b>What is the Procedure for a TLC Snap-On Smile</b>
				The procedure for a Snap-On Smile is simple, quick, and easy.  We first conduct a brief examination to confirm your suitability for a Snap-on Smile and carefully review the desired style and shade of your smile.  We then take exact measurements and impressions of your teeth that are sent to a highly specialized laboratory for preparation of your Smile.   When you return for a final fitting, we adjust the Snap-On Smile for optimal comfort, chewing, and appearance; provide you with a cleaning kit and instructions; and in a snap, you have a dazzling “Dream Smile”.<br>
			</p>									
			<p>
				<b>Gentle Comfort</b><br>
				In the preparation of your Snap-On Smile, you will enjoy the comfort of our signature “Gentle Dentistry.”<br>
			</p>				
			<p>
				<b>TLC Snap-On Smile Durability</b><br>
				With proper care, your Snap-On Smile will last for several years in much the same way as Partial Dentures and Night Guards. <br>
			</p>
			<p>

				The Snap-On Smile reflects our motto: “The Art of Gentle Dentistry.”  We provide for your comfort throughout the procedure and for your dental health in a completely functional set of teeth.  And in artfully shaping and color coding your model, we make your Dream Smile come true.<br>
