			<h3>Dislodged, Lost, or Significantly Chipped Crown</h3>

				If a crown is dislodged, lost, or significantly chipped, the tooth should promptly be treated by TLC Dental to prevent infection and further damage.  If the crown is chipped and repairable, we will repair it.  If it is dislodged or lost, we will carefully examine and clean your tooth and effect any needed post and buildup restoration.  We then will clean and emplace a dislodged crown or provide the tooth with a temporary crown in place of a lost crown pending completion of a permanent replacement. Throughout your crown procedure you will enjoy the comfort of our signature “Gentle Dentistry.”<br>
