			<i><h1>Introduction</h1></i>
			<p>
				The TLC Dental Group Blog is devoted to sharing common experiences with our family of patients: the joy of greeting old friends as they enter the office, the pleasure of welcoming new patients, the laughter of children in the Lego area,  Our Blog tells of transforming dental concerns into dental content and dental fears into dental confidence. It is also a sharing of good times outside the office such as greeting patient families at ZooBoo, at school events, and at local festivities.
