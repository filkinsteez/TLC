			<h3>Introduction</h3>
			<p>
				The TLC Dental Group Blog is devoted to sharing common experiences with our family of patients: the joy of greeting old friends as they enter the office, the pleasure of welcoming new friends, the laughter of children in the Lego area.  It is also a sharing of good times outside the office: greeting old and new patients at civic and charitable events such as ZooBoo, at school events, and at local festivities.  
			</p>
			<p>
				Our Blog tells of transforming dental concerns into dental content and dental fears into dental confidence.  It also recounts new developments in dental technology, advances in dental treatments, discoveries in dental research, and new connections between dental and general health. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In short, our Blog is akin to sitting around a kitchen table with friends and family while sharing a cup of coffee and tidings of the dental day.
