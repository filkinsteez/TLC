			<h3>Snoring</h3>
			<p>
				Some 30 million Americans snore while asleep during which the tongue, throat, and muscles in back of the soft palate relax, collapse, and narrow the airway.  Restricted breathing then causes the soft palate and uvula, at times accompanied by tonsils and adenoids, to vibrate and knock against the back of the throat thereby producing the distinctive sound of snoring.<br>
			</p>
			<p>
				Snoring may be caused or exacerbated by numerous factors including enlarged tissues in the nose, mouth or throat, blocked nasal passages, a deviated nasal septum, loss of muscle tone in the throat, alcoholic consumption, obesity, and certain medicines. <br>
			</p>
			<p>
				Although snoring is a staple of countless cartoons and comedies, it is not a laughing matter when it comes to your health. Snoring may not only disrupt the sleep of others but also your own sleep.  More notably, it may precede sleep apnea and more serious sleep disorder symptoms including morning headaches, daytime lethargy, high blood pressure, memory impairment, and loss of sexual drive.<br>
