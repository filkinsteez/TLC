			<h3>Dental Bonding</h3> 
			<p>
				Bonding or Composite Bonding is an alternative procedure to veneers in which a tooth-colored composite resin is applied to the surface of a tooth to dramatically improve dental appearance.  It is a simple, comfortable, and popular way to cover imperfections and achieve a radiant smile.

				<b>Bonding Procedure</b><br>
				Unlike veneers, bonding is generally a one visit procedure.  Initially, we discuss your desired dental enhancements and carefully examine your teeth to establish their suitability for bonding. We then draw on our years of experience to select a composite resin color that closely matches your teeth, microscopically etch the tooth surface, lightly layer it with a conditioning liquid, and apply the colored composite resin.  Once in place, we carefully smooth the composite into shape, cure it with a special bonding light, and then polish it to give your teeth a new and vibrant look. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Gentle Comfort</b><br>
				Throughout your bonding procedure, you will enjoy the comfort of our signature “Gentle Dentistry.”
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Bonding Composition</b><br>
				The TLC bonding procedure is done with a modern composite resin that, when cured, is noted for its luster, hardness, and durability.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Bonding Durability</b><br>
				The durability of a bonded tooth is largely dependent on good dental hygiene and regular dental checkups to militate against staining.  With proper care, bonding may last for many years.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Bonding Appearance</b><br>
				In its creation, emplacement, and ultimate appearance your bonding will reflect our motto “The Art of Gentle Dentistry.”  We provide for your comfort in the procedure and for your dental health in sound and functional bonding.  And in artfully shaping, coloring, and polishing your bonding, we provide truly resplendent additions to your “Dream Smile.”
