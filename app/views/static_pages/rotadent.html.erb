				<b>TLC Rotadent vs. Manual Toothbrush</b><br>
				Quite simply, the TLC Rotadent has rendered the manual toothbrush obsolete in maintaining your dental health and Dream Smile.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The TLC Rotadent was clinically proven to remove 92% of plaque in its first minute of use, twice as fast as a manual toothbrush.</li>
				<li>In a ten year study, almost 70% of Rotadent users exhibited good to very good oral hygiene levels compared to 25% for manual toothbrush users.</li>
			</ul>

			<p><br>
				The proprietary MicroAccess filaments on the Rotadent®  fit into tight interproximal spaces that conventional brushes can’t reach. These filaments, along with the 360-degree sweeping action — a feature only found on the Rotadent®  — clean out plaque and bacteria from these difficult-to-reach areas.<br><br>

			<p>
				<b>TLC Rotadent vs. Drugstore Electric Toothbrushes</b><br>
				The comparison between a TLC Rotadent and a drugstore electric toothbrush is akin to that of a TLC tooth whitening and a drugstore tooth whitening.  There is simply no comparison.   The TLC Rotadent dramatically outperforms any drugstore electric toothbrush as evidenced by this video.<br>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Lifetime Warranty</b><br>
				Further attesting to the disparity in quality and performance between a TLC Rotadent and a drugstore electric toothbrush is the limited Lifetime Warranty that you enjoy with a TLC Rotadent.<br>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Maintain Your Dental Health and Dream Smile</b><br>
				Because of its exceptional cleaning capacity for teeth and gums the TLC Rotadent is the centerpiece of TLC Dental’s Soft Tissue Management Program that enables you to attain and maintain your dental health.  And in this way it contributes invaluably to your “Dream Smile”.<br>
