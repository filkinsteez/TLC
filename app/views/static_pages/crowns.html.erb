			<h3>Dental Crowns</h3> 
			<p>
				A crown or cap is a complete and permanent cover for a damaged tooth or an implant that it strengthens and protects. A crown also supports the surrounding teeth, preserves proper “bite,” and projects a healthy and radiant appearance.

				<b>Crown Procedure</b><br>
				At TLC Dental we carefully examine and clean your tooth, precisely prepare and measure it for a crown, and when your permanent crown is completed to our exacting specifications, we adjust it for optimal comfort, chewing, and appearance and then cement your now enviable crown in permanent place.

				<b>Gentle Comfort</b><br>
				In the preparation and emplacement of your crown, you will enjoy the comfort of our signature “Gentle Dentistry”.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Crown Composition</b><br>
				TLC Dental crowns may be of ceramic variants such as empress, cerenate, etc, a metal alloy such as gold, high grade porcelain, or high grade porcelain fused to a metal alloy.  The choice of composition is based on the location of the tooth and attendant dental and aesthetic considerations
			</p>			
			<p>
				<b>Crown Durability</b><br>
				The durability of a crown, just like that of a normal tooth, is largely dependent on good dental hygiene and regular dental checkups.  With proper care, crowns may last for many years.  
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Crown Appearance</b><br>
